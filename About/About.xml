<b>Anima Animals Combined</b> 
This mod introduces new animals that I was asked to make when the original mod came out on the Steam Workshop.  Currently no alterations have been made.
---	
<b>Features:</b>
   • Anima Thrumbo: extremely powerful beast, gives milk and valuable fur. It has a sharp and hard horn and a heart which can be eaten in order to form psylink.
   • Anima Warg: bigger, stronger and faster than a regular warg. It can serve well as a colony defender, though you can butcher it and receive an anima warg's razorfang which can be used as a weapon or you can make a makeshift razorfang knife from it.
   • Anima Bear: huge and powerful creature. It has its own anima tree growing on its back. You can use it to spread psychic sooth in range.
   • Anima Yak: gives very expensive, insulating and beautiful wool. It gives milk much less frequently than a regular yak.
   • Anima fox: can haul a lot, nuzzles every 12 hours. 
   • Anima megaspider: quite strong, gives anima berries every 5 days. 
   • Anima muffalo: has decent carrying capacity. 
	
<i>Requires the Royalty expansion for Rimworld.</i>
